# Color Sleuth

<center><image alt="App Logo" width="100" src="./assets/logo.png"></center>

This is a game about finding the square with a different color. I had always wanted to experiment with making apps and this seemed like a perfect way to get started!

## Technologies

-   React Native
-   Expo (A framework used to make developing React Native apps easier)
-   JSX/JavaScript (Used as part of React Native)

## Playing

The app can be downloaded for free on the iOS App Store [here](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/color-sleuth/id1604077102). I plan to release the app on the Google Play Store in the future
as well as making it fully web compatible and hosting it on my own web server.

## Features

-   A dark and light theme that can be toggled between
-   A high score that is saved to the devices local storage
-   Integration with Apple's share menu to share your high score
-   The game itself, where you play to get the highest score possible

## Future Plans

The biggest thing I want to do is continously fix bugs and keep the app supported. In the future I also want to test and release the app on Google Play Store/Android devices as well as make it compatible with web. Currently web is not supported due to some dependencies only working on iOS. I didn't release for Google Play Store at the start due to not having an Android device to test on. I also plan to add more settings if any are suggested.

## Sources

The main sources I referenced during development were mostly React Native and Expo documentation. I also found a helpful function to darken and lighten colors from StackOverflow, which helped tremendously. I also looked up how to do things whenever I ran into issues, as this was my first time ever using React Native (and really React in general).

-   React Native Docs - <https://reactnative.dev/docs/components-and-apis>
-   Expo Docs - <https://docs.expo.dev/>
-   Programmatically Lighten or Darken a hex color (or rgb, and blend colors) - <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5560248/programmatically-lighten-or-darken-a-hex-color-or-rgb-and-blend-colors>
